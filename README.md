This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
##Techstack
Frontend: React, NextJs

## Purpouse of project
The goal is to increase the utilization of our school library. Many students do not even know what books are available. Gettting important information like this from the library requires physical contact with a school librarian, who is not always present to consult. The app solves this problem by providing an up to date information, which even a non-tech savvy school employee can easily maintain.

## how to run

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

set up your own psql db and connect to it
